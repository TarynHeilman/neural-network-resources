# Neural-Network Resources

This will aim to be a curated (and somewhat) commented list of neural-network resources, starting from the basics and working from there. This repo. is inspired by [awesome-deep-vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision), [awesome-computer-vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision), [awesome-deep-learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning/blob/master/README.md), and the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repo in general. It's also inspired by the desire to filter through those resources, and grab those which are most helpful in terms of diving into neural networks and deep learning. 

Driven by these motivations, the authors/collaborators will only be putting resources on here that have been vetted and found helpful or useful (unless otherwise noted - we might have a folder with links to things we've checked out but didn't find useful). Obviously this is highly opinion-based, so please feel free to reach out and shoot suggestions our way. We'd love to check out some resources that you have found helpful and see if we think so, too. The ultimate goal is to pare down the loads and loads of resources out there into the one or two per topic that are most helpful.  In the end, maybe we'll end up with a roadmap of how to get into deep learning with neural networks.  

Given the goal, this repo. will be a work in progress, and will probably move slowly. The idea is not to put anything on here that hasn't been properly vetted or checked out. That means things like books/courses will take a little while to be added.
