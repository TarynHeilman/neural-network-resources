# Convolutional Neural Nets 

This folder will contain resources more or less related to topics that apply either specifically to convolutional neural nets, or generally to nets but maybe work differently or were revolutionary to introduce to convolutional neural nets.

## Table of Contents

Fairly short for now, but it'll be built out over time.
