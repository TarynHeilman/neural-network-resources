##### [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - Michael Nielsen

This is by far the most approachable neural net resource that I have come across thus far. It is also fairly comprehensive in what it covers. Nielsen does well at realizing his stated purpose of the book: "... to help you master the core concepts of neural networks, including modern techniques for deep learning." He covers the basics of what you need to know to get up and running with neural nets, and he does it at a high enough level to be pretty digestible. I would read the [about](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/about.html) section of the book to get an idea of what to expect, but I highly recommend reading this. Overall, this is a great first resources for diving into nets.  

*Note*: Although the example that Nielsen uses ends up in a convolutional net at the end of the text (Chapter 6), the remainder of the book is about general neural net topics.
