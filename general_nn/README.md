# General Neural Nets 

This folder will contain resources more or less related to topics that apply generally across all neural nets, and not just a specific kind like covolutional or recurrent neural nets (among others). Some of the resources might discuss the topics through the lens of a specific kind of net, but we'll try to keep only topics that apply to all neural nets (to at least some degree) in this README.  

## Table of Contents

Fairly short for now, but it'll be built out over time.
